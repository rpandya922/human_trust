                In this task, the robot knows nothing about the arms and is learning to maximize its total reward by selecting them. At each iteration, the highlighted arm will indicate the arm the robot wants to pull next. You will simply need to click the "Next" button to progress through the robot's decisions. You do not need to click the other buttons yourself, simply observe how the robot is learning. 
            </p>
            <p>
                In this scenario, each arm has a colored box above it, indicating its value. The best arms are nearly white, the worst arms are black, and those in between are gray. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Finally, remember that these arms are different than those you've seen before.

            In this task, the robot knows nothing about the arms and is learning to maximize its total reward by selecting them. Highlighted arms are the robot's suggestion. If multiple arms are highlighted, it has no preference. Your task is to maximize your reward over 30 iterations. Click any arm to advance through each iteration.

                Remember that these arms are different than those you've seen before.
